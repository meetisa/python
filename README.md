# self-minesweeper
This is a minesweeper version that takes as input an image. Then use pygame's engine to produce the tipical minesweeper enviroment, with the same rules.
The player can play it forever with the same image, no matter the winning or losing.
Actually some modules aren't made by myself, here there's the list of the source files I take on the internet:
-spritesheet.py;
-resize.py;
-clustering.py;
